				<p class="practice-title">network cables</p>
				<p class="practice-description">Network cables are used to connect and transfer data and information between computers, routers, switches and storage area networks</p>
			</div>

				<p class="practice-title">types of network cables</p>
				<p class="practice-description">1. Coaxial Cable. Coaxial cables have a single copper conductor at the center, while a plastic layer provides insulation between the center conductor and braided metal shield</p>

			<div class="hand-tools-box">
				<p class="practice-description">2. Fiber Optic Cable - A fiber-optic cable, also known as an opticalfiber cable, is an assembly similar to an electrical cable, but containing one or more optical fibers that are used to carry light.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="hand-tools-box">
				<p class="practice-description">3. Shielded twisted-pair (STP) cabling is more expensive than unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling. It has an impedance of 150 ohms, has a maximum length of 90 meters, and is used primarily in networking environments with a high amount of EMI due to motors, air conditioners, power lines, or other noisy electrical components..</p>
			</div>

			<div class="hand-tools-box">
				<p class="practice-description">4. UTP stands for Unshielded Twisted Pair cable. UTP cable is a 100 ohm copper cable that consists of 2 to 1800 unshielded twisted pairs surrounded by an outer jacket. They have no metallic shield. This makes the cable small in diameter but unprotected against electrical interference</p>

			<div class="hand-tools-box">
				<p class="practice-title">cat6</p>
				<p class="practice-description">A Cat 6 cable is used mainly for computer networks reaching a Gb, 1000 Mbps or one Gbps of data transfer speed (DTR) or higher. It is also more thicker that the CAT5e UTP cable.</p>
			</div>
			<img src="img/cat.jpg" class="practice-img">

			<div class="hand-tools-box">
				<p class="practice-title">cat5e</p>
				<p class="practice-description">CAT5e, also known as Category 5e or Category 5 Enhanced, is a network cable standard ratified in 1999. Devices connected by the cable, including switches and routers, should also support the desired data speeds. Cable technology is backward compatible. Cat5e provides a bandwidth of 100 MHz performance, though cables are available with up to 350 MHz capabilities.</p>

				<p class="practice-title">network diagram</p>
				<p class="practice-description">A network diagram is a representation of network architecture in visual form. It depicts the network's topology using a variety of symbols and line connections.</p>
